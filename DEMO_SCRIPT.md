**Key Stats:**
- 10 AWS Services integrated
- 10 AI Agent functions deployed
- All running serverlessly on Lambda
- <$85/month operational cost
- Production-grade monitoring

## 2. Live Frontend Demo (3 min)

**Open:** http://msp-intelligence-mesh-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com

**Show:**
1. Main Dashboard - Network overview
2. Threat Intelligence - Real-time threat detection
3. Client Health - ML-powered churn prediction
4. Workflow Demo - Multi-agent collaboration

**Script:**
"This frontend is hosted on S3 with static website hosting. All pages connect to our API Gateway, which orchestrates 10 Lambda functions. Let me show you a live threat analysis..."

*[Click Threat Intelligence page, submit "Ransomware attack detected"]*

"Notice the sub-second response time. This is powered by AWS Lambda with X-Ray tracing enabled."

---

## 3. AWS Architecture Tour (3 min)

**Open AWS Console:**

1. **Lambda Dashboard**
   - Show all 10 functions
   - Highlight metrics (invocations, duration, errors)
   - Point out X-Ray tracing enabled

2. **API Gateway**
   - Show REST API with 10 endpoints
   - Demonstrate CORS configuration
   - Show deployment stage

3. **CloudWatch Dashboard**
   - Custom dashboard: `msp-intelligence-mesh-dashboard`
   - Real-time metrics
   - Alarms configured

4. **DynamoDB Tables**
   - Show 4 tables (agent-state, results, threats, websocket)
   - On-demand capacity mode
   - Encryption enabled

---

## 4. AI/ML Integration (2 min)

**Highlight:**
1. **AWS Bedrock**
   - NLP Query agent uses Claude 3 Haiku
   - 24 Claude models available
   - ~$0.00025 per request

2. **AWS Comprehend**
   - Market Intelligence sentiment analysis
   - Entity detection
   - Real-time processing

**Script:**
"We're using AWS's native AI services - Bedrock for conversational AI and Comprehend for sentiment analysis. This gives us enterprise-grade AI without managing infrastructure."

---

## 5. Live API Test (2 min)

**Terminal Demo:**

```bash
# Test Threat Intelligence
curl -X POST https://mojoawwjv2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/threat-intelligence \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "DDoS attack detected"}'

# Test NLP with Bedrock Claude
curl -X POST https://mojoawwjv2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/nlp-query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are our top security concerns?"}'

# Test Client Health ML
curl -X POST https://mojoawwjv2.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/client-health \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"client_id": "TEST_001", "ticket_volume": 50, "satisfaction_score": 4}'
```

**Show:**
- Sub-second response times
- Real AI model outputs
- Data persisted to DynamoDB

---

## 6. Monitoring & Observability (2 min)

**CloudWatch:**
- Dashboard with 6 widgets
- Lambda invocations graph
- Error rates
- API Gateway metrics

**X-Ray:**
- Service map showing Lambdaâ†’DynamoDBâ†’S3
- Trace details with timing
- Performance bottleneck detection

**CloudWatch Alarms:**
- 3 alarms configured
- SNS email notifications
- Proactive error detection

---

## 7. Cost Optimization (1 min)

**Show AWS Budget:**
- $100/month limit
- 80% alert threshold
- Current spend: ~$15-20

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. Serverless (no idle costs)
2. On-demand DynamoDB
3. 7-day log retention
4. Single-region deployment
5. Right-sized Lambda memory

**Script:**
"This entire system costs less than $85/month to run. That's the power of serverless - you only pay for what you use."

---

## 8. Security & Compliance (1 min)

**Highlight:**
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Secrets Manager for API keys
- S3 + DynamoDB encryption at rest
- X-Ray tracing for security audits
- Budget alerts to prevent overruns

**Script:**
"Security is built-in from the ground up. All secrets are in AWS Secrets Manager, encryption is enabled everywhere, and we have comprehensive audit trails through X-Ray."

---

## 9. Network Effects Demo (2 min)

**Show Workflow Demo:**
Open: http://msp-intelligence-mesh-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/workflow-demo.html

**Run:**
1. Threat Response scenario
2. Show multi-agent collaboration
3. Highlight final combined output

**Script:**
"This demonstrates the network effect. When one agent detects a threat, it triggers a coordinated response across multiple agents - threat analysis, collaboration matching, resource allocation, and client protection - all working together in real-time."

---

## 10. Closing & Q&A (2 min)
